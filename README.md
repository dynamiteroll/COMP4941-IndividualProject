# COMP4941-IndividualProject

Some react + asp.net core + MS SQL server CRUD application in progress.

So far:

Basic login and registration is complete, hashing and proper session variables is still a work in progress. Everything else still not done.

Some requirements:
connect using your own MS SQL server instance/connectionString
run asp.net backend using visual studio
run react frontend with visual studio code with cmd npm start (this is CRA btw)
